In my game I have a 3D map gameObject named "map" 
Inside the map there is a "Player" gameObject
also in the scene there is a camera, the camera has a script that has a public GameObject PlayerObject; 
In the scene the Player GameObject is assinged to the camera's "GameObject PlayerObject" 
I want to turn the "map" into a prefab (so that I can handle level generation) while the maintaining the relation between camera and player object 
how can I do this
