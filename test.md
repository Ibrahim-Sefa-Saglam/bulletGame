make a script that will gather data for my game, 
I want this script to 
calculate the average damage of last 10 delivered bullets, 
calculate the average damage of all delivered bullets,  
calculate the average generation rate, 
calculate the average delivering rate,
calculate the average panel time of last 10 delivered bullets,
calculate the average panel time of all delivered bullets,

all of these attributes are float variables and will be incremented by other scripts via methods
